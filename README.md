# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction

The telecom industry is highly competitive due to the wide range of service providers available to consumers. One of the major challenges faced by telecom companies is customer churn, which is the rate at which customers discontinue their service.

This project is part of a Maven Analytics challenge and is based on a fictional dataset from Maven Communications, a California-based telecommunications company. The goal is to analyze churn behavior, uncover key drivers behind customer attrition, identify patterns, and recommend targeted actions to improve customer retention.

In this project, I assume the role of a BI Consultant, tasked with presenting findings and strategic insights to the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) in the form of a concise, one-page Power BI dashboard.

## Project Overview




## Business Objectives

The objective of this project is to support Maven Telecommunications in improving customer retention by:

- Identifying high-value customers at risk of churning.
- Uncovering the key drivers of customer churn.
- Profiling customers who churned, joined, and stayed to understand behavioral differences, that is, identifying key differences in tenure, service usage, contract type, and monthly charges.
- Providing actionable insights and visualizations in a single-page Power BI dashboard tailored for executive review.

This project ultimately aims to help the company retain more customers, especially those who contribute significantly to revenue and long-term business value.
